## How to contribute to Donut

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/plowteam/donut/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/plowteam/donut/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, including your expected outcome vs your observed outcome.

* **Keep issues focused and easy to understand** by limiting discussion to the technical
problem only. An issue shouldn't take more than a few minutes for a person to read and
understand.

* Be aware that issues are limited to the scope of the original reported bug. If a new bug is found while
investigating an existing issue, a new issue should be opened.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
